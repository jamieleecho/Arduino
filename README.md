# Arduino #

This repository contains simple Arduino projects that illustrate how the platform can be used to perform simple tasks.

* **Cadnza** plays a nice song that originally appeared in William Barden Junior’s book "TRS-80 Color Computer and MC-10 Programs”.
* **MultiColorLEDDemo** demonstrates how to cycle through some of the colors of RadioShack’s Full Color LED (276-028). This program uses the CPU to dim the LED elements by rapidly turning digital outputs on and off.
* **MultiColorLEDDemoPWM** demonstrates how to cycle through some of the colors of RadioShack’s Full Color LED (276-028). This program uses PWM channels to dim the LED elements.
* **SimpleSerialDemo** demonstrates how to communicate via the Arduino UART. It implements a very simple language that turns the LED elements of RadioShack’s Full Color LED (276-028) on and off.
